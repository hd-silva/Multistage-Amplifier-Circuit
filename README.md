# Multistage-Amplifier-Circuit
The purpose of this project is to design, simulate, analyze, implement, and test a single-supply, 15- V, multistage, transistor amplifier which fulfills a set of specifications.


## Specifications
- Open-circuit (no-load) voltage gain: |AVo| = 50 (±10%)
- Number of transistors (stages): no more than 3 BJTs
- Power supply: +15V relative to the ground
- Output resistance: no larger than 500 Ω
- Input resistance: no less than 80 kΩ
- Quiescent current drawn from the power supply: no larger than 5 mA
- Maximum no-load output signal swing: no less than 8 V peak to peak
